# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis on Housing Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a case study that implements multiple linear regression to analyze a housing dataset. The goal is to understand how various features of the houses influence their selling prices.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises various attributes of houses, including:
- Area (in square feet)
- Number of bathrooms
- Number of stories
- Proximity to main roads
- Availability of guest rooms
- Presence of hot water heating and air conditioning
- Parking facilities
- Preference for a particular area
- Furnishing status (furnished or unfurnished)

## Model
The analysis employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to estimate the relationship between the dependent variable (price) and multiple independent variables. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and statistical significance of the predictors.

### Key Findings
- The model successfully identifies the significant predictors that impact housing prices.
- The R-squared value indicates that a notable proportion of the variance in housing prices can be explained by the model.
- The coefficients of each variable provide insights into how changes in each feature are expected to affect the house prices.

## Installation
To run this analysis locally, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g., pandas, statsmodels, numpy, etc.).
